      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2471">There are many '''templates''' in use in {{SITENAME}}; these are only a subset, representing some of the most important and commonly used ones. If you feel that a template belongs on this page, do not hesitate to add it.
* [[:Category:Templates]] should cover all templates in the wiki.
* The Template namespace (found from [[Special:AllPages]]) always has all templates in the wiki, sorted alphanumerically.

== What are templates? ==
Wiki templates provide a means to insert the same content over and over in different (or the same) pages. This saves editors the hassle of duplicating the same text again and again, and also helps ensure consistency.

Templates are generally shown with the format required to use the template (e.g. &lt;code&gt;{{t|delete}}&lt;/code&gt;). Clicking the template name takes you to the template's page, where you can see what it looks like and how it is used.

'''Detailed instructions on the usage of each template should exist on:'''
# '''a subpage using {{t|documentation}}'''; or
# the template page itself (inside &quot;noinclude&quot; tags); or
# the template's talk page.

For more information on templates, see [[Help:Templates]].

== Article management templates ==
=== Nominate an article for deletion ===
{{t|delete}}
* Add this to an article to nominate it for deletion. It will add the article to [[:Category:Candidates for deletion]].

=== Disambiguation articles ===
{{t|disambig}}
* If you have several articles that have similar or identical names, you may wish to create a &quot;disambiguation&quot; page at the main article name, with the articles taking an extra phrase in brackets afterwards. For example:
: '''The Prince''' &lt;-- disambiguation page, with links to:
:: The Prince (frog)
:: The Prince (human)
* Using {{t|disambig}} marks an article as a disambiguation page by adding a banner to the article and categorizing it under [[:Category:Disambiguations]]. Add links to the various articles under the banner.
* For more information, see [[Help:Disambiguation]].

== General wiki templates ==

=== T is for template ===
{{t|t|template}}
* This template allows you to show example template code (with a link to the templates) without using the template itself. It is used extensively on this page.

== Where you may find more templates ==
* [[w:c:templates|Templates Wiki]]
* Wikipedia; may be copied with the proper acknowledgment, but some need tweaking to work properly on Wikia, so use a Wikia version if possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2023">==Description==
This template is used to insert descriptions on template pages.

==Syntax==
Add &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{t|documentation}}&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the template page.

Add &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{t|documentation|documentation page}}&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to transclude an alternative page from the /doc subpage.

==Usage==

===On the Template page===
This is the normal format when used:

&lt;pre&gt;
TEMPLATE CODE&lt;includeonly&gt;Any categories to be inserted into articles by the template&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;
{{documentation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

''If your template is not a completed div or table, you may need to close the tags just before &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{documentation}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is inserted (within the noinclude tags).''

''A line break right before &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{documentation}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can also be useful as it helps prevent the documentation template &quot;running into&quot; previous code.''

===On the documentation page===
The documentation page is usually located on the /doc subpage for a template, but a different page can be specified with the first parameter of the template (see [[#Syntax|Syntax]]).

Normally, you will want to write something like the following on the documentation page:

&lt;pre&gt;
==Description==
This template is used to do something.

==Syntax==
Type &lt;code&gt;{{t|templatename}}&lt;/code&gt; somewhere.

==Samples==
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;nowiki&gt;{{templatename|input}}&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; 

results in...

{{templatename|input}}

&lt;includeonly&gt;Any categories for the template itself&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Template documentation|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Use any or all of the above description/syntax/sample output sections. You may also want to add &quot;see also&quot; or other sections.

Note that the above example also uses the [[Template:T]] and [[Template:T/piece]] templates.

&lt;includeonly&gt;[[Category:Templates|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Template documentation|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1812">;Description
:This template is used to create a basic navigation box. You can do so by calling the template, via the steps under &quot;Syntax&quot;, but it is recommended to '''copy the code verbatim''' via the steps under &quot;Navbox Creation&quot;.
;Navbox Creation
&lt;createbox&gt;
prefix=Template:
preload=Template:Navbox
editintro=Template:Navbox/doc
buttonlabel=Make your navbox!
default = Navbox Foo
&lt;/createbox&gt;
#Think of a name for your navbox, like &quot;Navbox Foo&quot;. Type it in the above field, press the button, and save the page immediately. Be ready to return to ''this'' page to see the rest of the instructions.
#Edit the resulting page in source mode.
#Replace &lt;code&gt;{{{header}}}&lt;/code&gt; with the text you would like to appear in the header.
#Replace &lt;code&gt;{{{body}}}&lt;/code&gt; with the text you would like to appear in the body.
#To add another section, copy these four lines of code immediately below the lines in the existing code that they resemble:
&lt;pre&gt;|-
! style=&quot;padding:0.2em 0.5em;&quot; nowrap=&quot;nowrap&quot; class=&quot;color1&quot; | {{{header}}}
|-
| style=&quot;padding:0.2em 0.5em;&quot; | {{{body}}}&lt;/pre&gt;

Save the page once you have added as many sections as you needed, and filled them with content. You may also want to create a /doc subpage explaining that to call the resulting template, one must only type &lt;code&gt;{&lt;nowiki/&gt;{Navbox Foo}}&lt;/code&gt;, or rather, whatever we decided to name the template in step 1.

;Syntax

&lt;pre&gt;{{navbox
|header=Land of Bob
|body=This &lt;nowiki&gt;[[place]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and that &lt;nowiki&gt;[[place]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

:Results in...

{{navbox
|header=Land of Bob
|body=This &lt;nowiki&gt;[[place]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and that &lt;nowiki&gt;[[place]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
}}

One fateful day Reiker decided to don the now infamous Reiker Template profile picture. Quite quickly others began to edit it to thier own sonas and use it, a notable example is [[Icemare]].

The virus even spread beyond the Furry_irl server by the user [[Storm]], who infected a sergal splinter server.

== Behavior ==
A regular response to the phrase &quot;you are gay&quot; by '''Bimmer''' is &quot;No u&quot; followed by a space and regularly 2 or 3 exclamation marks. Comments such as &quot;You are cute&quot; and uttering the stinky nickname &quot;Bummer&quot; (only used by mean and ugly people) will be met with the same response.

Whenever '''[[Reiker]] '''joins the chat a friendly exchange of greetings filled with several exclamation marks and &quot;:3&quot; will ensue.

During the large Marriage RP, '''Bimmer''' and Reiker were forcibly married by the pastor [[Seasnakez]]. It is unclear whether they are still married or in a so called &quot;bromance&quot;.

* '''Bimmer '''is a very cute wolf and has very pretty eyes
* He's an artist, and draws high quality art
* He loves Reiker more than anything, but is too afraid to say it.</text>

== Early Life ==
Bimmer came into existence on the eve of Christmas 2018. His first words were, &quot;merry crumber&quot;. Being a new user, he had yet to use a Discord profile picture, and after some suggestions from users [[Icemare]] and [[RazzberryHyena]], decided on using the default &quot;blurple&quot; Discord profile picture slightly enlarged and off centre, a little off to the left.

Soon after, he would begin pestering [[Reiker]], calling him gay repeatedly (as a joke though).

== Appearance ==
When Bimmer joined the Furry_irl Discord server, he had yet to create a fursona, meaning that he was merely a floating voice at the time. However, during the Reiker Profile Picture epidemic, he wished to participate, thus designing a fursona in the process; he edited his profile picture onto Reiker's profile picture, creating the iconic blurple wolf we all know and tolerate today.

Bimmer, standing at a mere 5 feet and 2 inches (and that's being generous), is rather short. While other users around his stature may complain, he embraces his small size as a part of his identity.

Bimmer has relatively thick fur on his face and neck, its density decreasing around his torso and legs to reveal his lean, slightly toned figure. 
[[File:1546197758463.png|thumb|181x181px|The classic.]]
Bimmer's style typically includes clothes from the brand GOLF, Tyler, the Creator's fashion brand, thus making him a lowkey hypebeast. He also wears caps, and to wear them, he cuts holes out of their sides for his ears to comfortably stick out of. He has admitted to owning multiple Minecraft™ t-shirts. He wears socks at all times to prevent himself from being infected with the Big Gay™.

Bimmer, although not a homosexual, enjoys makeup and often wears colourful eyeshadow, mascara and brightly-coloured contact lenses. 

== Behavior ==
A regular response to the phrase &quot;you are gay&quot; by '''Bimmer''' is &quot;no u&quot;, followed by a space and regularly 2 or 3 exclamation marks. Comments such as &quot;You are cute&quot; and uttering the stinky nickname &quot;Bummer&quot; (only used by mean and ugly people) will be met with the same response.

Whenever Reiker''' '''joins the chat a friendly exchange of greetings filled with several exclamation marks and &quot;:3&quot; will ensue.

Bimmer performs homiesexual acts openly, such as giving his homies no homo smooches, hugs and cuddles.

== Relationship/s (?) ==
[[File:Thanks . very cooll.png|thumb|316x316px|Bimmer wearing a piece of clothing gifted to him by Reiker.]]
Soon after joining, Bimmer, being a homiesexual, developed homie-feelings for Reiker. However, being socially awkward, he would merely tease Reiker, calling him &quot;gay&quot; or a &quot;dork&quot;. This escalated into a situation where he was invited to Reiker's house, who promised to &quot;cook him a nice lunch and then punch him very hard&quot;. Bimmer accepted the offer without hesitation and the two were, officially, from that day on, homies4lyf.

Other so-called &quot;homies&quot; include [[Videos]], [[Dyngo]] and [[Rovilux]]. The list goes on, as he typically accepts homieship with anyone who asks.

During the large Marriage RP, '''Bimmer''' and Reiker were forcibly married by the pastor [[Seasnakez]]. It is unclear whether they are still married or in a so called &quot;bromance&quot;, as this event was never brought up ever again.

== Trivia ==
* '''Bimmer '''is a very cute wolf and has very pretty eyes.
* He's an artist, and draws high quality art.
* He loves Reiker more than anything, but is too afraid to say it.
* He listens to K-pop, Death Grips and Tyler, the Creator almost exclusively, due to his abhorrent taste in music. However, his favourite songs of all time are [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Dpw0VvH4m0 1, 2 Oatmeal] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44MyrH4jwOQ Mario Be Playin' T-Dub].
* He sometimes has vague memories of being a Snow Leopard, perhaps from a past life.
* He is also terrible at keeping secrets.</text>

Villi always has his eyes closed (with few exceptions). This is not just because he's always tired, but also because opening his eyes for more than a few seconds at &gt;10% power would wipe out the universe, and he doesn't feel like creating it again. However, he is still able to see.

Villi has technically made money off of music which technically means he is able to call himself a 'professional freelance musician,' however most have described the fox as 'unemployed,' which may be more fitting.

Despite almost having the exact same appearance, Villi is in fact ''not'' Reiker, and indeed they are two different people, though some have theorised that they are the same person simply putting on accents&lt;sup&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/sup&gt;. A passerby on the street also claimed that he once saw them in the same coat pretending to be one person, however this is most likely false considering their combined height would be over 14'.

Villi always has his eyes closed (with few exceptions). This is not just because he's always tired, but also because opening his eyes for more than a few seconds at &gt;10% power would wipe out the universe, and he doesn't feel like creating it again. However, he is still able to see. When he does have his eyes open, it is usually at 1% power and only for a small amount at a time, ensuring nobody gets hurt, though some have reported getting a slight sunburn.

== Music ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;He's just a bit rubbish really.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''-Simon Cowell, on Villi's ability as a musician.''

Villi often creates music, however it is fairly amateur and his talents lie less in music making and more in writing hilarious articles about himself&lt;sup&gt;[citation desperately needed]&lt;/sup&gt;. He plays a handful of instruments, but usually makes ambient music as he &quot;finds it a bit of a chore to actually dig out his guitar and plug it in and everything.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Villi, 2019&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Villis do not naturally sing, and as such he's rather bad at it.

Villi has technically made money off of music which technically means he is able to call himself a 'professional freelance musician,' however most have described the fox as 'unemployed,' which may be more fitting.

== Trivia ==
* The origin of Villi's name are a mystery to all... Mostly because nobody really gives a shit about it.
* Villi is a vehement defender of Vegemite, and all who disrespect it are quickly destroyed.
* His favourite band is Sigur Ró&lt;em&gt;s, &lt;/em&gt;yet his favourite singer is Josh Pyke.
* 9/10 headpat experts agree that Villi's headpats are scientifically the best.
* Villi's fur is infinitely floofy, to the point that some claim his internal organs just don't exist and instead it's just more floof. The scientific impossibility of this is debatable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3435">'''Wing''' is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda Red Panda]. Known to be quiet and nerdy, he's been in the fandom for six months, and manages to still be without a fursona. Typically seen in both SFW and NSFW chats, but much more of a lurker than anything. On the r/furry_IRL Discord, his favorite thing to do is shitpost, bully people in #sfw-chat and add emote reactions to damn-near everything. {{wing-test|image1 = File (166).jpg|caption1 = Accurate depiction of a fursona-less Wing.|aliases = Wing, Gay, Ugly, Wingypoo|title2 = Biographical Information|martial_status = Single|date_of_birth = 11/01/1996|birthplace = Hell|title3 = Physical Description|species = Red Panda|gender = Male|eye_color = Hazel}}

== '''Biography''': ==

=== Early Life ===
Born in the arctic of the United States, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota Minnesota], Wing has adapted to the typically cooler climate of the Midwest. He has lived in the same town for all of his life and plans to eventually move to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin Wisconsin], unfortunately nowhere further south where things are much warmer. During his life in Minnesota he grew up as a shy boy, and could be described as a teacher's pet as he never misbehaved often. Being both shy and adjusted to the cold he picked out a Red Panda as his animal/fursona.

===&lt;nowiki/&gt;===

=== Later Years ===
After his graduation from elementary school, things took a turn for the better when Wing started to attend a small K-12 school in his town. He was more social, and met now long-time friends - one that he could place the blame on for exposing him to the world of furries.

====&lt;nowiki/&gt;====

=== Furry Life ===
The first known contact Wing had with the furry fandom dates as far back as the early 2010's, when a close friend of his had him sign up for the social media network [https://www.tumblr.com/ Tumblr], and later had him hooked on a few fandoms such as Andrew Hussie's web-comic, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestuck Homestuck]. In the comic one of the characters, [https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Jade_Harley Jade Harley], associated herself with the furry fandom such as plushies and toys. Additionally, there were a few animal-like characters in the comic such as [https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Nepeta_Leijon Nepeta Leijon], who while is not a cat herself would act like one  and had horns shaped like cat ears. Beyond this, Wing showed some interest in the ''Warriors [https://warriorcats.com/ (Warrior Cats)] ''novels. Finally, there's belief Wing's interest in World of Warcraft's [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Pandaren Pandaren] and [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Worgen Worgen] races contributes to falling into the furry fandom. 

In the late Summer of 2018, Wing decided to come with terms of things and accepted himself as a furry. It's at this point he's following artists on Twitter, browses r/furry_IRL and takes part in their Discord chat as the degenerate he is.

== Trivia ==
# One of his first messages on the Discord server was &quot;hewwo&quot;.
# Used to play on an (un-official) Minecraft server for the Discord and was a professional dirt-hut builder.
# Despite his interest in technology, is currently stuck with a boring job at a hotel. 
# Wing has been a Fox main as far back as Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3415">'''Wing''' is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda Red Panda]. Known to be quiet and nerdy, he's been in the fandom for six months, and manages to still be without a fursona. Typically seen in both SFW and NSFW chats, but much more of a lurker than anything. On the r/furry_IRL Discord, his favorite thing to do is shitpost, bully people in #sfw-chat and add emote reactions to damn-near everything. {{wing-test|image1 = File (166).jpg|caption1 = Accurate depiction of a fursona-less Wing.|aliases = Wing, Gay, Ugly, Wingypoo|title2 = Biographical Information|martial_status = Single|date_of_birth = 11/01/1996|birthplace = Hell|title3 = Physical Description|species = Red Panda|gender = Male|eye_color = Hazel}}

== '''Biography''': ==

=== Early Life ===
Born in the arctic of the United States, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota Minnesota], Wing has adapted to the typically cooler climate of the Midwest. He has lived in the same town for all of his life and plans to eventually move to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin Wisconsin], unfortunately nowhere further south where things are much warmer. During his life in Minnesota he grew up as a shy boy, and could be described as a teacher's pet as he never misbehaved often. Being both shy and adjusted to the cold he picked out a Red Panda as his animal/fursona.&lt;nowiki/&gt;
=== Later Years ===
After his graduation from elementary school, things took a turn for the better when Wing started to attend a small K-12 school in his town. He was more social, and met now long-time friends - one that he could place the blame on for exposing him to the world of furries.&lt;nowiki/&gt;
=== Furry Life ===
The first known contact Wing had with the furry fandom dates as far back as the early 2010's, when a close friend of his had him sign up for the social media network [https://www.tumblr.com/ Tumblr], and later had him hooked on a few fandoms such as Andrew Hussie's web-comic, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestuck Homestuck]. In the comic one of the characters, [https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Jade_Harley Jade Harley], associated herself with the furry fandom such as plushies and toys. Additionally, there were a few animal-like characters in the comic such as [https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Nepeta_Leijon Nepeta Leijon], who while is not a cat herself would act like one  and had horns shaped like cat ears. Beyond this, Wing showed some interest in the ''Warriors [https://warriorcats.com/ (Warrior Cats)] ''novels. Finally, there's belief Wing's interest in World of Warcraft's [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Pandaren Pandaren] and [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Worgen Worgen] races contributes to falling into the furry fandom. 

In the late Summer of 2018, Wing decided to come with terms of things and accepted himself as a furry. It's at this point he's following artists on Twitter, browses r/furry_IRL and takes part in their Discord chat as the degenerate he is.

== Trivia ==
# One of his first messages on the Discord server was &quot;hewwo&quot;.
# Used to play on an (un-official) Minecraft server for the Discord and was a professional dirt-hut builder.
# Despite his interest in technology, is currently stuck with a boring job at a hotel. 
# Wing has been a Fox main as far back as Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64

Known to be quiet and nerdy, he's been in the fandom for six months, and still hasn't totally decided on a fursona. Typically seen in both the SFW and NSFW chats of r/furry_irl's Discord, and likes to bully people, calling them cute.

There may be more explanation as to just ''why ''he's a furry, and like everybody else there's bits of exposure that eventually lead to the &lt;s&gt;degenerate&lt;/s&gt; interesting world of furries. 

== Trivia ==
# One of his first messages on the Discord server was &quot;hewwo&quot;.
# Considered himself straight as little as three years ago, now just a full-on homo.
# Aspires to play both piano and guitar, but continues to be shit at both. 
# Started video editing and graphics design at age 10, sadly doesn't do both as much now.
# Can draw a pretty wicked stick figure. Take that, artists.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="429">On 2018-05-16, the mods launched an emote poll to refresh the previously stale emotes that the server had. This was preceded by the Great Emote Purge, which happened only 48 hours before. During this 96 hour period, turmoil struck as new emotes were voted upon. In the end, only a select few emotes made it of the nearly 100 emotes submitted. This is considered a key event for the Second Emote War that happened later that year.</text>

A vorey snek boi who is heteroflexible for his BF Shoob, and is most often found in #sfw-chat.

Has a propensity for science, history, and obscure video games. May or may not be secretly plotting to eat various other server members.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="575">On &lt;time&gt;2018-11-23, the mods opened up a second round of emote polling. With several spaces open, the goal was to fill as many as possible with good emotes. Lessons learned from the First Emote War made this round of polling better, with new and old emotes being pit against each other simultaneously and with more rules for submissions. Even more emotes were submitted this time, but preliminary quality checks meant that a fraction of those made it to voting. &lt;/time&gt;

&lt;time&gt;In the end, all still image slots were filled and several new animated emotes were added. &lt;/time&gt;</text>

Kern is a Raccoon, he draws for people on occasion but not by request, notably [[Dord]] or [[Chamington|Cham]]

his fursona is a chubby 5’3” raccoon, with a hint of purple,

== Behavior ==
According to a Myers-Briggs test he took, he is ESFP-T

He is especially extroverted, and seen to be happy when he’s with his close friends

he tends to joke around alot, and saying weird things nobody really asked to hear

Sometimes it is heard that he wishes to be witg his friends.

== The  &quot;Dord Cult&quot; ==
in his time in the server he had a phase where he had displayed a liking to Dord, according to him this was &lt;u&gt;completely platonic&lt;/u&gt; and the most plausible answer is that it is. This was misinterpreted by many, starting the idea of a ''&quot;Dord cult&quot; ''

== &quot;DORDS RIGBY&quot; ==
''Dord's Rigby ''was a small inside joke started by him, spammed in the same way like  ''THANOS CAR''

=== Origin ===
&quot;Dords rigby&quot; was likely started by his irl friend, Conan. while remains uncertain it might have somethung to do with a quot from Dord himself saying: ''&quot;You are my rigby, Kern&quot;''

== Trivia ==
* he has a t-shirt that says “UwU” on it
* he draws [[Dord]]’s fursona more than dord himself does
* he  used to be known as “Coon”
* his name, Kern comes from an optical phenomena called a Kern Arc
* according to Dord, he’s his “rigby”, “best man”, and adoptive son before he disowned him.
* Dord disowned him after being told to control his son.
* according to Dord, he’s like a brother to him, Kern said he had teared up when he heard that.
* it’s possible that Kern considers Dord and Cham are his close friends, according to the way he behaves around them.</text>

Kern is a Raccoon, he draws for people on occasion but not by request, notably [[Dord]] or [[Chamington|Cham]]

his fursona is a 5’3” raccoon with a bit of tummy nd with a hint of purple,

== Behavior ==
According to a Myers-Briggs test he took, he is ESFP-T

He is especially extroverted, and seen to be happy when he’s with his close friends

he tends to joke around alot, and saying weird things nobody really asked to hear

Sometimes it is heard that he wishes to be witg his friends.

== The  &quot;Dord Cult&quot; ==
in his time in the server he had a phase where he had displayed a liking to Dord, according to him this was &lt;u&gt;completely platonic&lt;/u&gt; and the most plausible answer is that it is. This was misinterpreted by many, starting the idea of a ''&quot;Dord cult&quot; ''

== &quot;DORDS RIGBY&quot; ==
''Dord's Rigby ''was a small inside joke started by him, spammed in the same way like  ''THANOS CAR''

=== Origin ===
&quot;Dords rigby&quot; was likely started by his irl friend, Conan. while remains uncertain it might have somethung to do with a quot from Dord himself saying: ''&quot;You are my rigby, Kern&quot;''

== Trivia ==
* he has a t-shirt that says “UwU” on it
* he draws [[Dord]]’s fursona more than dord himself does
* he  used to be known as “Coon”
* his name, Kern comes from an optical phenomena called a Kern Arc
* according to Dord, he’s his “rigby”, “best man”, and adoptive son before he disowned him.
* Dord disowned him after being told to control his son.
* according to Dord, he’s like a brother to him, Kern said he had teared up when he heard that.
* it’s possible that Kern considers Dord and Cham are his close friends, according to the way he behaves around them.</text>

He has recently begun to pick up a hobby for drawing, albeit drawing quite infrequently and, on certain occasions, for others too.

He is 180cm tall or 5&quot;11, therefore making him quite the unit for his age.

== Behaviours &amp; Traits ==
According to the Myers-Briggs test, he comes under the INFP personality type.

Due to this, he is independent and introverted, although his morale and mood is bolstered when he is around the people he is most comfortable with or closest to him.

His humour is enjoyable, though strange and overly literal at some times to say the least

== Behaviors ==
Usually enters the chatroom with &quot;&gt; Logging In&quot; and leaves with &quot;&gt;Logging Out&quot;. Has a generally friendly behavior but sometimes goes into crisis which brings mood down. A large lack of understanding of the lingo used in the fandom is a common cause of shock of disbelief to this user.

Due to his asperations of becoming a game designer, his speech patterns will usually revolve around games if in a happy mood.

Talking about his Furry-ness will lead to two results, harsh rebuttals or mild acceptance, he never seems to fully agree to the possible concept, further testing is required.

== Catchphrases ==
* &quot;Salutations&quot;
* &quot;FrickleFracklePickle&quot;
* &quot;There is no such thing as certainty, only a possibility...so go for it, who knows what will happen?&quot; 

- Personal Quote
* &quot;Sore Wa Chigau Yo&quot; 

- Danganronpa

== Trivia ==
* The name Neutral Horizons came from an idea with a bunch of his own real life friends to build a game studio that never happened.
* Neutral never plans to have a fursona ever, due to a fear of aggravating his imposter syndrome some more.
* Despite being an agent, his success rate in missions is a measly 10%, which should have him fired in real life.
* Despite being the supposed normie of the group, he has drawn five times more furry art than his regular ones.
* Neutral is easily bribed with food, or friendship, use it to take advantage of him.</text>

=== Summary ===
A wildcard furry_irl user from the Philippines, a midway greeter to most other users and is generally uninteresting as a whole.

== Behaviors ==
Usually enters the chatroom with &quot;&gt; Logging In&quot; and leaves with &quot;&gt;Logging Out&quot;. Has a generally friendly behavior but sometimes goes into crisis which brings mood down. A large lack of understanding of the lingo used in the fandom is a common cause of shock of disbelief to this user.

Due to his asperations of becoming a game designer, his speech patterns will usually revolve around games if in a happy mood.

Talking about his Furry-ness will lead to two results, harsh rebuttals or mild acceptance, he never seems to fully agree to the possible concept, further testing is required.

== Catchphrases ==
* &quot;Salutations&quot;
* &quot;FrickleFracklePickle&quot;
* &quot;There is no such thing as certainty, only a possibility...so go for it, who knows what will happen?&quot; 

- Personal Quote
* &quot;Sore Wa Chigau Yo&quot; 

- Danganronpa

== Trivia ==
* The name Neutral Horizons came from an idea with a bunch of his own real life friends to build a game studio that never happened.
* Owns a personally handmade furry stop motion puppet made from scrap cloth, one of his prized possessions.
* Neutral never plans to have a fursona ever, due to a fear of aggravating his imposter syndrome some more.
* Despite being an agent, his success rate in missions is a measly 10%, which should have him fired in real life.
* Despite being the supposed normie of the group, he has drawn five times more furry art than his regular ones.
* Neutral is easily bribed with food, or friendship, use it to take advantage of him.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="690">== '''TheGeekyHen''' ==
TheGeekyHen (also known as Hen, Henry, Geeky and Stuart) is an annoying Chicken with too much free time. With all this free time, he likes to Draw (which, according to himself, very poorly), listen to Music, chat on the Server and defend his &quot;heterosexuality.&quot;

His Fursona is (as previously stated) a Chicken, sporting a Red Hoodie and Reading Glassses.

== '''Behaviour''' ==
According to a Myers-Briggs test he took, he is INFJ-T

He leans more towards Introverted, and enjoys talking with people on the Server. However, IRL he'll struggle holding small talk. 

He tends to joke around alot, however he has been warned and muted for taking it too far on ocassion.</text>

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''&quot;Y-you better say No Homo before reading this page... Gayboy!&quot;''' - ''TheGeekyHen (This exact moment in time)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''TheGeekyHen '''is a moody Chicken with too much free time. 

His Fursona is, as just stated, a Chicken named Charlie, sporting a Red Hoodie and Reading Glasses.

== Behaviour ==
{{Infobox_character|image = TheGeekyHen.png|imagecaption = A simple headshot of Charlie, his Fursona.|aliases = Geeky, Gay, Hen, Henry, Stuart|marital = Unknown|birthDate = 23rd May 2XXX|deathDate = Soon|species = Chicken|gender = Male|eyes = Green}}According to a Myers-Briggs test he took out of boredom, he is INFJ-T (The Advocate)

IRL he comes off as very introverted, struggling to hold conversations longer than 2 minutes before feeling the need to run as far away as possible.

In sfw-chat, he tends to joke around a lot, and when overcome by a great amount of mood, he will rant about whatever insignificant problem has upset him.

When his &quot;heterosexuality&quot; is threatened, he will say whatever it takes to make sure you believe he is not Gay, because (quoted directly from the interview) &quot;I'm totally not and if you think so then you're incredibly stupid, you Gayboy.&quot;

== Trivia ==
* '''TheGeekyHen''' and '''Bimmer'''[https://furryirl.fandom.com/wiki/Bimmer] are the only two straight people in the server.
* He claims to come from, and live in Scotland.
* It has been agreed upon by the server that he is cute, despite his many objections. He has taken this so far at one point that he got blocked by someone.
* He has a passion for Drawing, but lacks the motivation to even bother looking up tutorials.
* He used to persue in learning French, until acquiring the knowledge that &quot;French is Gay&quot; from his friend, Shoob.
* It is unknown what he looks like IRL. He refuses to post a picture of himself because he hates how he looks.
* It hasn't been entirely disclosed what type of Music '''TheGeekyHen''' enjoys, however, the muffled voices of VOCALOID can be heard from his room.
* Bayani appears to have a crush on him, '''TheGeekyHen''' has yet to tell us his thoughts on this.</text>

=== '''Biography''' ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;A furry? Why would I be one ''them?&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Early Life ====
Born in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland Finland] and adapting to the anti social climate '''Seasnakez''' was stripped of the ability to make eye contact or speaking in the furry baby tongue of Hewwo. However, his life changed when he moved to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden Sweden]. Entering a new climate filled with furry-ism and degeneracy he was able to reintroduce himself to society and several degenerate communities.

==== The Dark Years ====
During the first time after the move to Sweden a large calamity fell over young '''Seasnakez''' mind, and the very first step to entering the furry community was taken. Shortly after establishing in his new country he entered the [https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/My_Little_Pony_Friendship_is_Magic_Wiki My Little Pony] fandom and was deeply influenced by their artwork and culture. During the height of the dark years the first few ideas of what would later bloom into his love for more questionable aspects of furry culture.

==== Furry Life ====
The first notable contact with the furry fandom was done through the subreddit &quot;Furry_irl&quot; and his active time there includes such gems as &quot;Thank you for the support this community has given me so I no longer have to be with my toxic friends&quot; [https://www.reddit.com/r/furry_irl/comments/8x4qsb/furryirl/ link]. A post jumping on the wholesome bandwagon which would guarantee up paws, however it backfired since when he got found out as a furry by his real life friends they took the post literally.

=== '''Behavior''' ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;*Eats you*&quot;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;In sfw-chat '''Seasnakez''' can be found making inappropriate remarks about users and uttering semi-nsfw sentences in hopes of attention. On the whole, however he's a wholesome and huggable snakes who enjoys getting and receiving digital affection.

=== '''Role in the Swedish Furry Wetwork (SFW)''' ===
Founder and Leader of the Swedish Furry Wetwork (SFW), '''Seasnakez''' does absolutely nothing since the organization is barely coherent and functional.

=== Trivia ===
* His first message was &quot;H-hewwo&quot;
* His favorite music has been described as &quot;Just noise, how can you listen to this?!&quot;
* &lt;s&gt;Actually doesn't enjoy lewding chat but does it for attention as he's very bored and doesn't know what he will do with his life.&lt;/s&gt; (Deleted, reason: Superfluous Information)

== Biography ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;A furry? Why would I be one ''them?&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Early Life ===
Born in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland Finland] and adapting to the anti social climate '''Seasnakez''' was stripped of the ability to make eye contact or speaking in the furry baby tongue of Hewwo. However, his life changed when he moved to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden Sweden]. Entering a new climate filled with furry-ism and degeneracy he was able to reintroduce himself to society and several degenerate communities.

=== The Dark Years ===
During the first time after the move to Sweden a large calamity fell over young '''Seasnakez''' mind, and the very first step to entering the furry community was taken. Shortly after establishing in his new country he entered the [https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/My_Little_Pony_Friendship_is_Magic_Wiki My Little Pony] fandom and was deeply influenced by their artwork and culture. During the height of the dark years the first few ideas of what would later bloom into his love for more questionable aspects of furry culture were planted.

=== Furry Life ===
The first notable contact with the furry fandom was done through the subreddit &quot;Furry_irl&quot; and his active time there includes such gems as &quot;Thank you for the support this community has given me so I no longer have to be with my toxic friends&quot; [https://www.reddit.com/r/furry_irl/comments/8x4qsb/furryirl/ link]. A post jumping on the wholesome bandwagon which would guarantee up paws, however it backfired since when he got found out as a furry by his real life friends they took the post literally.

== Behavior ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;*Eats you*&quot;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In sfw-chat '''Seasnakez''' can be found making inappropriate remarks about users and uttering semi-nsfw sentences in hopes of attention. On the whole, however he's a wholesome and huggable snakes who enjoys getting and receiving digital affection.

== Role in the Swedish Furry Wetwork (SFW) ==
Founder and Leader of the [[The Swedish Furry Wetwork (SFW)|Swedish Furry Wetwork (SFW)]], '''Seasnakez''' does absolutely nothing since the organization is barely coherent and functional.

== Role in the Reiker and Bimmer Marriage ==
During the large sfw-chat marriage roleplay '''Seasnakez''' acted as a pastor and forcibly married [[Bimmer]] and [[Reiker]]. Under the kidnapping '''Seasnakez''' locked the car trunk in which Reiker resided in, thus extending the RP by 10 minutes and garnering chat wide hate for the duration, however gaining short lasted support from [[Icemare]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1405">'''The Swedish Furry Wetwork (SFW)''' is an organization made by Swedish furries for Swedish furries in a mission to take over the furry_irl discord.

== History ==
Before the creation of '''SFW''' (not to be confused with the anagram Safe-For-Work) Swedish furries often exclaimed their existence by yelling &quot;SWEDE GANG&quot; in chat. To simplify the process of recruiting members '''SFW''' was made Februari the first 2019.

== Mission ==
The main goal of '''SFW''' is to show the superiority of Swedish furries and oppress non-swedish speakers with incomprehensible garbage such as &quot;Hej&quot; and &quot;Jag gillar köttbullar&quot;. (If you didn't understand that you are not eligible to join '''SFW'''.

== Relations ==

=== Allies ===
* Furries of Finnish Ethnicity
* Furries who identify as Birds
* Furries who identify as Snakes (one notable exception is [[Doobs Zoopity|Doobs]])

=== Enemies ===
* Furries of Danish Ethnicity
* Furries of Norwegian Ethnicity who don't recognize Sweden as superior
* Furries who don't recognize Sweden as the superior nordic, and global country

== Members ==
* [[Seasnakez]], Founder and Leader
* [[Icemare]], Second in command

== Trivia ==
* The name is a pun on the anagram Safe-For-Work
* The word Wetwork is a play on words to fit the pun-filled anagram, the original word was Network
* Members have been frequently seen talking about alleged &quot;danskejävlar&quot;

Gayboy!&quot;''' '''''- '''TheGeekyHen''', 02/01/2019

'''TheGeekyHen''' is an annoying Chicken with too much free time, a regular on the F_IRL Server, and not gay.

His Fursona, as just mentioned, is a Chicken called Charlie, sporting a red hoodie and a pair of reading glasses.

== Behavior ==
According to a Myers-Briggs test he took online, he is an INFJ-T

IRL, he tends to lean more towards introverted, especially in School or in Public. Studies have shown he struggles to hold a conversation for longer than 2 minutes, before feeling the need to run as far away as possible.

In the F_IRL Server, he is quite talkative and mood. He tends to joke around alot, mainly via self-deprecation. If his mood hits extreme levels, he will spew out a slur of words that appear to be whatever insignificant problem is bothering him at the time.

When questioned about his sexuality, he will go to extreme lengths to make sure you believe he is straight, because (and I quote from the interview) &quot;I totally am, and anyone who doesn't believe me is either gay and wants me to be, or is an ignorant dummy.&quot;

When called cute, he gets really defensive, and will quite gladly explain and ramble on about how he's not. More recent studies have shown that he's grown to accept being called cute, because most people on the server have come to the agreement that he is, for some retarded reason.

== Free Time ==
With all his free time, '''TheGeekyHen''' doesn't really get up to much, due to his procrastinating nature.

He has a passion for Drawing, but lacks the motivation to even bother looking up tutorials on where to get started. It used to be what he commonly whined about, but thankfully he's simply declared that &quot;anyone who is remotely good at Art knows black magic and should be burned.&quot;

He seems to enjoy Music, specifically playing on Keyboard and listening to it. Nobody knows exactly what kind of Music he enjoys, however if you listen closely, the muffled voices of VOCALOID can be heard coming from his room.

== Trivia ==
* '''TheGeekyHen''' is not gay, and cannot stress enough that he is straight. These claims have yet to be officially confirmed, but he has threatened us with a Copyright Strike if we do not mention it at least three times in this Page about him.
* Bayani, another regular on the F_IRL Server, seems to have a crush on him. He has yet to make a statement on Bayani having a crush on him, and has instead just teased him.
* As of writing this, he has been muted 3 times on the F_IRL Server, and has been warned once.
* He has been blocked by someone for trying to come up with a theory on why this someone keeps calling him cute.
* He claims that he was born in, and lives in Scotland.</text>

== Biography ==

=== Early time in Furry_irl ===
During his debut '''Icemare''' was primarily known for his &quot;hourly hugs&quot;, giving out digital hugs every hour. However the ensuing wave of greetings and hugs ruined any ongoing conversation and was outlawed.

== Behavior ==
'''Icemare''' can be often seen lurking in sfw-chat and reacting to posts with appropriate emotes. Such stimulus will trigger an angry emote, or if he's in a good mood, an entry to the written language.

A distinct feature of '''Icemare''' is his affinity for complimenting user, often using the word &quot;cute&quot;. Users will be given a digital hug for no apparent reason and responding to compliments with &quot;no u&quot; will result in resistance, and more compliments.

The current meta strategy is to say &quot;No u&quot; and then using fake stuttering to milk as many compliments as possible. Eg:

Ice: [User] is cute! *hugs*

User: No u

I: Yes you are!

U: N-no...

I: I think you are the cutest!

U: Lies!

etc...

== Trivia ==
* Ice is Swedish</text>

During his debut '''Icemare''' was primarily known for his &quot;hourly hugs&quot;, giving out digital hugs every hour. However the ensuing wave of greetings and hugs ruined any ongoing conversation and was outlawed.

== Behavior ==
'''Icemare''' can be often seen lurking in sfw-chat and reacting to posts with appropriate emotes. Such stimulus will trigger an angry emote, or if he's in a good mood, an entry to the written language.

A distinct feature of '''Icemare''' is his affinity for complimenting user, often using the word &quot;cute&quot;. Users will be given a digital hug for no apparent reason and responding to compliments with &quot;no u&quot; will result in resistance, and more compliments.

The current meta strategy is to say &quot;No u&quot; and then using fake stuttering to milk as many compliments as possible. Eg:

Ice: [User] is cute! *hugs*

User: No u

I: Yes you are!

U: N-no...

I: I think you are the cutest!

U: Lies!

etc...

== Role in The Swedish Furry Wetwork (SFW) ==
Second in command only to [[Seasnakez]] in The [[The Swedish Furry Wetwork (SFW)|Swedish Furry Wetwork (SFW)]], '''Icemare''' is a force to be reckon with inside the organization. His task include: Nothing. 

== Trivia ==
* Ice is Swedish
* His favorite pizza is banana curry
* He lives purely of Kebab for large periods of time, known as &quot;kebab-haitus&quot;
* His first message was &quot;eyo&quot;</text>

== Biography ==

=== Early time in Furry_irl ===
During his time first chatting, '''Icemare''' became a pretty common sight in sfw-chat, being active almost around the clock. The reason for this lying on him getting sick for a whole week.

==== Buwaro phase ====
During his earlier days Icemare had grown a great intrest in &quot;Slightly Damned&quot; a webcomic about a demon, angel and weird bunny-tail lady. This lead to him using buwaro (the demon) as his profile picture, coupled with &quot;dm for buwaro&quot; in his name, he spread several pictures of his favorite demon.

During this time, '''Icemare''' began his &quot;hourly hugs&quot;, giving out digital hugs every hour. However the ensuing wave of greetings and hugs ruined any ongoing conversation and was outlawed.

==== Actually getting a sona ====
Somewhere during october, while going through his halloween pfp phase (using a character called negaren), '''Icemare''' developed a sona. The sona in question being the least creative red panda in the whole world. Only thing about it that stands out being the blue-greyish eyes, the fangs on the mouth and the fez (the text reading ''bing'' with is chinese for ice).

It would take a few weeks more until actual art of his sona would exist, the first ever drawn pic being by the user '''RazzberryHyena'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="672">Keviniscool (NicknamedeKevinisferret) is a cool ferret who occasionally says hi in sfw or nsfw chat.

'''Biography'''

Born 12/12/2000 a cool ferret, he now roams the world looking for friends. He also is well known for being cool, and not being stinky, because if you think ferrets stink, you stink. He also hates editing wiki pages on mobile, so he'll finish this later

'''Conact'''

He can be contacted at KEVINISCOOL#4740 or https://steamcommunity.com/id/acheapcar/ also, follow his twitch account twitch.tv/Keviniscool if you like disappointment

* orn 12/12/2000, he is most well known for being super cool, and not being smelly, because ferrets aren't smelly.

He was on the discord every day before. And then he just went offline for no reason and never went back online. Nobody knows why.

Trashman is a wolf who spends most of his time procrastinating. If not making an attempt to write his space furry sci-fi book, he can be found doing the following:{{Infobox_character|name = Trashman1701|image = Sharon realease me from this image.png|imagecaption = Trashman in his natural state (Credit to Reiker for the template)|species = Wolf|gender = Male|height = About 6&quot;4'|weight = Roughly 150 Pounds|eyes = Brown|marital = is NOT gay so STOP SAYING THAT!!!!!}}
* Playing the clarinet (rarely)

* Watching either Stargate or Star Trek (But not Star Wars under any circumstances)

* Spending far too much time playing computer games 

=== Space Furry Book Info ===
Trashman, as stated earlier, is writing a book about space furries. It can be found on Fictionpress and Wattpad under the name Codename Alpha. Haha shameless self promotion am i right guys

=== Art Skill ===
None. Why do you think he writes rather than does art? IMBECILE!

===&lt;nowiki/&gt;===

=== Involvment in war crimes during the Yugoslav Wars ===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1059">On the miraculous day B. D. Santa was born, 400 new stars were discovered in the sky, grown men and women alike began weeping uncontrollably, and the sunset lasted for five more hours then it usually did. 

By the age of four, Santa had already constructed a Fortune 500 company from the ground up with his bare hands and was widely recognised as the smartest being in the universe (and still is!)

By the age of twenty Santa had married over 800 wives and had single handedly ended all war in the world. Rather then having a single day dedicated to him, every day in the calendar has been, for that is how great he is. Many countries have tried to elect him to President or Prime minister, only to receive one simple response from our Supreme Lord, Santa;

&quot;My heart belongs to all nations of this world, and it would be unfair to sit at the head of only one&quot; 

By the ripe age of 25, Our Supreme Lord Santa had joined all nations together as one and leads them onwards for the future of all mankind. All hail Supreme Lord Santa. All hail Supreme Lord Santa.</text>

I do things#0512|relatives = one brother who is not furry|marital = none lol|birthDate = august 2003|species = Golden retreiver|gender = Female|height = 5'9|weight = Idk not fat?|eyes = green}}Jolyn Dandy is a female golden retreiver and prominent member of Furry_irl's discord and subreddit. Usually affiliated with her nickname &quot;Dandy&quot;. Most Commonly seen in outfits inspired by JoJo's and cyberpunk, two of Jolyns favorite things. As well as described by herself &quot;a girl on Reddit with GIMP and a lot of free time.&quot;

Dandy's favorite movies are Redline, Spider man into the spider-verse, Blade Runner 2049, and Blackkklansmen.

== Interpretations ==
Dandy is in most interpretations a space explorer, traveling across the galaxy trying to replicate the great teachings of Dandyism, a religion Jolyn made up based after the teachings of space dandy. 

Others being a fantasy setting, where she has &quot;A sword so big guts will say 'wow thats a big sword.&quot; A cyberpunk where its the same but shes poor and doesn't have a spaceship, and the slice of life version, which is just her IRL. 

== Personality ==
Dandy has an upbeat and optimistic personality, though usually calm. Largely following &quot;the dandy way to live&quot; or &quot;going with the flow.&quot;.  

Though on discord she will have fits of annoyance or &quot;rants.&quot; These rants will involve stuff her brother did that was annoying, something at school, or she saw a movie that sucked ass. 

In the scenario where she watches a really good movie, she will talk for at least twenty minutes about it on discord, ignoring the previous or current conversation.

== Past ==
Dandy originally was male, but after awhile of thought she realized she didn't really want to be. While not under any transitions IRl (but definitely planning to), her sona has fully transitioned.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2005">KHTangent is a blue dragon who will appear at random in sfw-chat, then lurk for 30 minutes without saying anything. He currently studies communication technology in Norway. His motives for studying communication technology is unknown, as he has an almost complete lack of communication skills.

{{infobox character
 | name         = KHTangent
 | image        = [[File:KHTangent.png|thumb]]
 | imagecaption = 
 | aliases      = KHT, Tangent

 | weight       = Unknown
 | eyes         = Green
}}

== Description ==
KHTangent is a blue, poorly drawn, anthro dragon with green eyes.

== Personality ==
Not much is currently known about KHTangent, as he rarely writes more than a few messages a day. Based on this, one can conclude that he's very shy, which would be correct.

== Summoning KHTangent ==
Despite not being too active, KHTangent can sometimes be summoned in sfw-chat by doing one of the following:
* Mentioning him (may not work, as it's never been tested)
* Starting a chain of people saying a simple phrase in their native language. KHTangent will then emerge with a norwegian translation: Here's an example of this happening: &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code&gt; (conversation)
  Person 1: More cheese
  Person 2: Plus de fromage
  Person 3: Mehr Käse
  KHTangent: Mere ost&lt;/code&gt;
* Mentioning Norway or anything related to Norway in any way
* He will sometimes say hello if the chat is empty or very slow

== Trivia ==
* His name has nothing to do with Kingdom Hearts. It was made from the three norwegian math terms Katet, Hypotenus, and Tangent, meaning Cathetus, Hypothenus, and Tangent (line, not trig identity)
* KHTangent will never submit to [[The_Swedish_Furry_Wetwork_(SFW)|The Swedish Furry Wetwork]], and does not recognize Sweden as superior to Norway

Smol Boye Legend is the son of Reiker, he is a smol boye.

==Basic facts==

Smol Boye Legend is smol, because he just is.
Smol Boye is so smol, a picture cant be found. ;-;

==Urléntya==

Smol Boye Legend wasn't always Smol, he used to be a Big Boye until he was reincarnated. In the past, Smol Boye Legend had committed one war crime and one violation of human rights in the now non-existent nation of Urléntya. Urléntya doesn't exist anymore because of Smol Boye Legend's actions. Smol Boye Legend first started out as an Identification Card designer in the Urléntya government. He then bribed himself up to the top as the new Grand General of the smol nation. After the great crop failure of 2002, Smol Boye Legend declared a National Emergency and inforced Martial Law. He declared that the tiny Hyena minority was to blame for the crop failure, and sent 300,000 yeens to death camps in the Trebbitinia mountains and another 400,000 yeens were deported. This crippled the Urléntyian economy and sent the population into unrest until in 2004, surrounding nations invaded Urléntya and Smol Boye Legend was killed. His soul was then reincarnated into the Smol Boye we know now. Smol still has the memories of his Urléntyian past, but he likes to pretend his past soul did anything wrong. He has been convicted of other crimes since, but after he was reincarnated before he could be executed, he's been a good boye ever since.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4654">== Biography ==
Aleksandr Ostanin, also known as Santoz or Santoz1337, is a cisgender male human, born in the Russian Federation, in the town of ██████████ on the ████████. &lt;ref&gt;In 2017 a picture of Santoz1337's personal ID was leaked to a hacker database&lt;/ref&gt;He was born in the family of a █████████. The identity of Santoz's father remains unknown even though his fathername - Mikhailovich, suggests that his fathers name might be Mikhail or Michael. From the age of 6 Santoz attended ███████ and █████ ██████. At the moment of writing the article, Santoz is homeless and unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;Public reports from Russia's Revenue Service show no income and no taxes paid since 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Eyewitnesses say that he remains in his hometown to this day&lt;sup&gt;[needs proof]&lt;/sup&gt;. 

&lt;s&gt;IP logs show that from 2018 he might be a resident of Germany or France &lt;/s&gt; Further investigation shows that he is using a VPN to access the web. 

== Personality ==
&lt;em&gt;██████ &lt;/em&gt;has no confirmed data about Santoz's personality as his contacts with other people in real life are very infrequent and he, reportedly, left Russia only once, on his trip to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Photo set from Turkey hotel &lt;em&gt;███████ from ██.██.████ contains a picture of a teenager showing reseblance with Santoz's appearance from other leaked pictures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; No members of ██████ were able to get in contact with him so far.

== Online presence ==

=== General info ===
Santoz's online presence before 2016 is almost strictly limited to RU part of World Wide Web.&lt;ref&gt;Santoz accounts in russian forums and social networks are frequently online to this day&lt;/ref&gt; But since then numerous accounts with nicknames like Santoz, Santoz1337 and Santozz1337 appeared on international websites. 

Most notably, Santoz1337 seems to be an active member of &quot;furry&quot; community. Accounts claiming to be Santoz1337 have been seen on ██████ and in &quot;furry&quot; communities of ████████. Santoz is frequently seen in &quot;Discord&quot; servers.

=== Art ===
Since 2018 Santoz released █ experimental hip-hop albums.&lt;ref&gt;██████ utilizes bots to limit the amount of potentional listeners to prevent possible ███-████ outbreak.&lt;/ref&gt; His work seems to take inspiration from other artist of the genre like █████ █████ and █████████. Sound of his records is a lot more rough and unpolished and lyrical content doesn't make as much emphasis on violence and drug abuse as music of █████ █████. █████ workers have showed mild discomfort while listening to his work but no anomalous properties have been discovered in process.&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;What the hell is this music? Who on Earth would unironically listen to this? I'm getting paid for this but naw, I would rather mop the shitty floors in ███-███'s chamber&quot; - Doctor ██████&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Analysis of Santoz's online persona ==
Santoz seems to be acting on behalf of his fictional characters most of the time. His main persona is a hooded figure, dressed in a trench coat, with a bandana covering its(?) face&lt;ref&gt;This character is represented by the cover-art of Santoz's music album ██ ██████ ██ ███████.&lt;/ref&gt;. His secondary, much less frequently used character is a tall orange fox with hair fading from white to cyan. This character seems to be more representative of Santoz himself as this character is frequently seen wearing Santoz's clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Confirmed by comparing art of █████ and leaked pictures from ██████.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Online Santoz shows a very apathetic and grotesque personality. Further complicating the analysis, unlike other members of &quot;furry&quot; community, he rarely shows any form of affection or sympathy towards others and doesn't have defined &quot;character&quot; traits.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, at many times Santoz's statements contradict each other and portray him in opposite ways.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aleksandr Ostanin, also known as Santoz or Santoz1337, is a cisgender male human, born in the Russian Federation, in the town of ██████████ on the ████████. &lt;ref&gt;In 2017 a picture of Santoz1337's personal ID was leaked to a hacker database&lt;/ref&gt;He was born in the family of a █████████. The identity of Santoz's father remains unknown even though his fathername - Mikhailovich, suggests that his fathers name might be Mikhail or Michael. From the age of 6 Santoz attended ███████ and █████ ██████. At the moment of writing the article, Santoz is homeless and unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;Public reports from Russia's Revenue Service show no income and no taxes paid since 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Eyewitnesses say that he remains in his hometown to this day&lt;sup&gt;[needs proof]&lt;/sup&gt;. 

&lt;s&gt;IP logs show that from 2018 he might be a resident of Germany or France &lt;/s&gt; Further investigation shows that he is using a VPN to access the web. 

== Personality ==
&lt;em&gt;██████ &lt;/em&gt;has no confirmed data about Santoz's personality as his contacts with other people in real life are very infrequent and he, reportedly, left Russia only once, on his trip to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Photo set from Turkey hotel &lt;em&gt;███████ from ██.██.████ contains a picture of a teenager showing reseblance with Santoz's appearance from other leaked pictures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; No members of ██████ were able to get in contact with him so far.

== Online presence ==

=== General info ===
Santoz's online presence before 2016 is almost strictly limited to RU part of World Wide Web.&lt;ref&gt;Santoz accounts in russian forums and social networks are frequently online to this day&lt;/ref&gt; But since then numerous accounts with nicknames like Santoz, Santoz1337 and Santozz1337 appeared on international websites. 

Most notably, Santoz1337 seems to be an active member of &quot;furry&quot; community. Accounts claiming to be Santoz1337 have been seen on ██████ and in &quot;furry&quot; communities of ████████. Santoz is frequently seen in ███████ servers.

=== Art ===
Since 2018 Santoz released █ experimental hip-hop albums.&lt;ref&gt;██████ utilizes bots to limit the amount of potentional listeners to prevent possible ███-████ outbreak.&lt;/ref&gt; His work seems to take inspiration from other artist of the genre like █████ █████ and █████████. Sound of his records is a lot more rough and unpolished and lyrical content doesn't make as much emphasis on violence and drug abuse as music of █████ █████. █████ workers have showed mild discomfort while listening to his work but no anomalous properties have been discovered in process.&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;What the hell is this music? Who on Earth would unironically listen to this? I'm getting paid for this but naw, I would rather mop the shitty floors in ███-███'s chamber&quot; - Doctor ██████&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Analysis of Santoz's online persona ==
Santoz seems to be acting on behalf of his fictional characters most of the time. His main persona is a hooded figure, dressed in a trench coat, with a bandana covering its(?) face&lt;ref&gt;This character is represented by the cover-art of Santoz's music album ██ ██████ ██ ███████.&lt;/ref&gt;. His secondary, much less frequently used character is a tall orange fox with hair fading from white to cyan. This character seems to be more representative of Santoz himself as this character is frequently seen wearing Santoz's clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Confirmed by comparing art of █████ and leaked pictures from ██████.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Online Santoz shows a very apathetic and grotesque personality. Further complicating the analysis, unlike other members of &quot;furry&quot; community, he rarely shows any form of affection or sympathy towards others and doesn't have defined &quot;character&quot; traits.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, at many times Santoz's statements contradict each other and portray him in opposite ways.&lt;/ref&gt;

== INTERRUPTING THE TRANSMISSION... ... ... ...{{Additional_things}} ==

== The actual article ==
Santoz is just a dude who comes in the chat says hey and then disappears into the abyss.

fuck me, if you compare Santoz to Villi, Villi is like the musical demi-god while Santoz is a beggar praying for his Lord's mercy.

== Biography ==
Aleksandr Ostanin, also known as Santoz or Santoz1337, is a cisgender male human, born in the Russian Federation, in the town of ██████████ on the ████████. &lt;ref&gt;In 2017 a picture of Santoz1337's personal ID was leaked to a hacker database&lt;/ref&gt;He was born in the family of a █████████. The identity of Santoz's father remains unknown even though his fathername - Mikhailovich, suggests that his fathers name might be Mikhail or Michael. From the age of 6 Santoz attended ███████ and █████ ██████. At the moment of writing the article, Santoz is homeless and unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;Public reports from Russia's Revenue Service show no income and no taxes paid since 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Eyewitnesses say that he remains in his hometown to this day&lt;sup&gt;[needs proof]&lt;/sup&gt;. 

&lt;s&gt;IP logs show that from 2018 he might be a resident of Germany or France &lt;/s&gt; Further investigation shows that he is using a VPN to access the web. 

== Personality ==
&lt;em&gt;██████ &lt;/em&gt;has no confirmed data about Santoz's personality as his contacts with other people in real life are very infrequent and he, reportedly, left Russia only once, on his trip to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Photo set from Turkey hotel &lt;em&gt;███████ from ██.██.████ contains a picture of a teenager showing reseblance with Santoz's appearance from other leaked pictures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; No members of ██████ were able to get in contact with him so far.

== Online presence ==

=== General info ===
Santoz's online presence before 2016 is almost strictly limited to RU part of World Wide Web.&lt;ref&gt;Santoz accounts in russian forums and social networks are frequently online to this day&lt;/ref&gt; But since then numerous accounts with nicknames like Santoz, Santoz1337 and Santozz1337 appeared on international websites.

Most notably, Santoz1337 seems to be an active member of &quot;furry&quot; community. Accounts claiming to be Santoz1337 have been seen on ██████ and in &quot;furry&quot; communities of ████████. Santoz is frequently seen in ███████ servers.

=== Art ===
Since 2018 Santoz released █ experimental hip-hop albums.&lt;ref&gt;██████ utilizes bots to limit the amount of potentional listeners to prevent possible ███-████ outbreak.&lt;/ref&gt; His work seems to take inspiration from other artist of the genre like █████ █████ and █████████. Sound of his records is a lot more rough and unpolished and lyrical content doesn't make as much emphasis on violence and drug abuse as music of █████ █████. █████ workers have showed mild discomfort while listening to his work but no anomalous properties have been discovered in process. His music references apathy, suicidal tendencies, shows satire on modern rap music and is often performed from perspective of his &quot;alter-ego&quot; Real San&lt;ref&gt;Real San as described by Santoz1337 is

&quot;my crack-addicted neighbour who really wants to be a REAL rapper, hates Drake and Lil Wayne and is just a disgusting human being at times&quot;. 

This description is confirmed to be ironical as Real San is just Santoz rapping in a low, growly voice.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;What the hell is this music? Who on Earth would unironically listen to this? I'm getting paid for this but naw, I would rather mop the shitty floors in ███-███'s chamber&quot; - Doctor ██████&lt;/blockquote&gt;
== Analysis of Santoz's online persona ==
Santoz seems to be acting on behalf of his fictional characters most of the time. His main persona is a hooded figure, dressed in a trench coat, with a bandana covering its(?) face&lt;ref&gt;This character is represented by the cover-art of Santoz's music album ██ ██████ ██ ███████.&lt;/ref&gt;. His secondary, much less frequently used character is a tall orange fox with hair fading from white to cyan. This character seems to be more representative of Santoz himself as this character is frequently seen wearing Santoz's clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Confirmed by comparing art of █████ and leaked pictures from ██████.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Online Santoz shows a very apathetic and grotesque personality. Further complicating the analysis, unlike other members of &quot;furry&quot; community, he rarely shows any form of affection or sympathy towards others and doesn't have defined &quot;character&quot; traits.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, at many times Santoz's statements contradict each other and portray him in opposite ways.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavior ==
Quite flowery or at times gramatically incorrect, or replaces such simple words into one letter (very to v, you to u.)

May find himself just repeating hm or ahs quite a lot in order to understand almost everything that comes in his way without further questioning.

also, if you try to dm him and ask him about music and art and such. this individual will change into a new type of person. detailed and incredibly interested.

== FURSONA ==
Soluna: 

A wolf embued with the blessing of the sun and the moon, with this blessing, he is able to manipulate heat,light, as well as movement of the two solar beings.

Behavior:

Curious with a hint of cowardice, Soluna is undeniably silent, letting his sense of wonder move him around the place. Despite being quite fragile, it doesn't stop him from being oddly playful and letting his newly discovered strength to guide him along his struggles, simple or complex that may be.</text>

ВСЕ ВСТАЛИ НАХУЙ

Ф_ирл — священная наша держава,
Ф_ирл — любимый наш фэндом родной.
Могучая воля, великая слава —
Пускай деграднёмся но нам всё равно!

Славься, Отечество наше свободное,
Братских фурфагов союз вековой,
Фуррями данная мудрость народная!
Славься, ф_ирл! Мы гордимся тобой!

От и сикс ту уан до дискордного края
Раскинулись наши леса и поля.
Одна ты на свете! Одна ты такая —
Хранимая нами родная земля!

Славься, Отечество наше свободное,
Братских фурфагов союз вековой,
Фуррями данная мудрость народная!
Славься, ф_ирл! Мы гордимся тобой!

Широкий простор для депрессии в жизни
Грядущие нам открывают года.
Нам силу даёт наша верность Отчизне.
Так было, так есть и так будет всегда!

Славься, Отечество наше свободное,
Братских фурфагов союз вековой,
Фуррями данная мудрость народная!
Славься, ф_ирл! Мы гордимся тобой!</text>

Sikuaq is a user that joined in August 2018, though he's only become active around February 2019. Born and always a resident in Maryland, he can be found riding crabs around the streets. Do not be fooled when he talks about his Slovenian nationality or residence in Vietnam, those are false memories from a previous life. He's known to make multiple fursonas, and has no intention of stopping. Sikuaq is also an amateur artist, making many profile pictures for himself.

== Biography ==

=== Early Youth ===
Born and raised in Maryland, Sikuaq and his family hopped around numerous houses in his early years. Some examples of them being: relative's houses, friend's houses, motels, a van, a homeless shelter, a Chick-Fil-A storeroom, and with a pack of wolves. 

=== Childhood ===
Sikuaq made his first friend in 3rd grade, later to lose them to the treacherous pit of Roblox. It's suspected that he's been viewing furry art since the age of 8, but has sat in denial of his own degeneracy until 2017.

=== Present ===
Today, Sikuaq can be found cooped up in his room drawing furries, watering his cacti, or laying in bed talking to furries online. The furry life has fully consumed him, and there's no chance of redemption.

== Behavior ==
Sikuaq is faily introverted and soft, but can get rowdy if put in the right mood (An example being him laughing for 40 minutes straight at one singular Tik-Tok meme.) He's known to love emojis, using emojis such as 🔞😡 to condemn people's sinful actions, or 😔👊 to express his sorrow. His typing style is unusual, finding any way to break common conventions of English (comma spam, randomly placed capitalization, screaming)

== Stance on Hatsune Miku ==
[[File:Hatsunesiku.png|thumb|220x220px|Sikuaq's Maned Wolf fursona after forcibly shoving them into Hatsune Miku cosplay.]]
Sikuaq is Head CEO of the Hatsune Miku Fan Club, and will defend her reputation to his last breath. He's done many things relating to her, drawing a decent amount of art and contributing to his Hatsune Miku shrine almost daily. His favourite Hatsune Miku artist is Pinocchiop.

Sikuaq is a user that joined in August 2018, though he's only become active around February 2019. Born and always a resident in Maryland, he can be found riding crabs around the streets. Do not be fooled when he talks about his Slovenian nationality or residence in Vietnam, those are false memories from a previous life. He's known to make multiple fursonas, and has no intention of stopping. Sikuaq is also an amateur artist, making many profile pictures for himself.

== Biography ==

=== Early Youth ===
Born and raised in Maryland, Sikuaq and his family hopped around numerous houses in his early years. Some examples of them being: relative's houses, friend's houses, motels, a van, a homeless shelter, a Chick-Fil-A storeroom, and with a pack of wolves. 

=== Childhood ===
Sikuaq made his first friend in 3rd grade, later to lose them to the treacherous pit of Roblox. It's suspected that he's been viewing furry art since the age of 8, but has sat in denial of his own degeneracy until 2017.

=== Present ===
Today, Sikuaq can be found cooped up in his room drawing furries, watering his cacti, or laying in bed talking to furries online. The furry life has fully consumed him, and there's no chance of redemption.

== Behavior ==
Sikuaq is faily introverted and soft, but can get rowdy if put in the right mood (An example being him laughing for 40 minutes straight at one singular Tik-Tok meme.) He's known to love emojis, using emojis such as 🔞😡 to condemn people's sinful actions, or 😔👊 to express his sorrow. His typing style is unusual, finding any way to break common conventions of English (comma spam, randomly placed capitalization, screaming.) Though a fair bit timid, he's always happy to talk to people, or have them throw him out numerous windows. 

== Stance on Hatsune Miku ==
[[File:Hatsunesiku.png|thumb|220x220px|Sikuaq's Maned Wolf fursona after forcibly shoving them into Hatsune Miku cosplay.]]
Sikuaq is Head CEO of the Hatsune Miku Fan Club, and will defend her reputation to his last breath. He's done many things relating to her, drawing a decent amount of art and contributing to his Hatsune Miku shrine almost daily. His favourite Hatsune Miku artist is Pinocchiop. 

== Art ==
Sikuaq's art style is a fair bit cartoonish while trying to keep some aspects of realism. His old art is iconic for large googley-like eyes and round corgi-eyebrows. Always adapting and always improving, aspects change all the time to suit his tastes. He's happy to draw for his friends, but does not have requests or comissions open.

== Notable Events ==

=== &quot;/r/askgayducks&quot; Group Chat ===
The &quot;/r/askgayducks&quot; Group chat is a group chat with some other members, one of them being [https://furryirl.fandom.com/wiki/Reiker Reiker]. As of writing this (April 26 2019,) the group chat has had a running call for a month (starting March 21, 2019.) Sikuaq, [https://furryirl.fandom.com/wiki/Reiker Reiker], and some other members practically live in the group chat and spend every minute of their aching lives in it. They haven't seen the sun since February.

=== Anti-Vaxx Roleplay Discord'''™''' (AVRD) ===
[[File:Ada.PNG|thumb|220x220px|Example of the conversations that consist in the Anti-Vaxx Roleplay Discord'''™''']]
The Anti-Vaxx Roleplay Discord'''™ '''is an Anti-Vaxx orientated Discord server run by Sikuaq where Anti-Vaxxers can roleplay in a safe environment away from persecution. Some (but not all) members are also affiliated with Flat Earthers. Though not that active today, the server is still up and available for people to join.

== Trivia ==
* Sikuaq is half Vietnamese, though has never spoken a full sentence of Vietnamese in his life.
* He is in the process of learning mandarin, and will often tell you that for breakfast he drank two loaves of bread.
* Though not 18+, it is generally known that he is atleast the age of Three.
* Despite having fursonas with species originating from warm climates, all of his fursonas are extensively over-fluffed (Except for his Kobold fursona, of course)
* Sikuaq is fairly secretive about it, he enjoys being hugged, patted, and Thrown out windows.</text>

Trivia:

Capes is still friends with people from almost 2 years ago on the server

He is one of the oldest still active users, and one of the longest to stay on the server continuously
