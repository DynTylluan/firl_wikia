# furry_irl Wikia

Sometime in 2019, some people from the subreddit [r/furry_irl](https://old.reddit.com/r/furry_irl) made a Wikia based on themselves and some common people who were regulars on the Discord server, sadly, this wiki has [never been saved via the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://furryirl.fandom.com/*) and I am guessing that this dump is the only archive of it.

These files were made thanks to Wikia offering a full download upon a wiki being deleted, so this is the whole thing, excluding images.

Either way, the wiki, much like all of the wikis on Wikia, is [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0), so enjoy that.
